1. Voltage, Power and Current Calculation (P = IV)
1. Application of the above learnt calculation in calculating the time of charge and the backup time of an Energy system(eg: a solar system)

### Arduino
1. What are Programmable ICs (and Arduino to be precise) and what are they capable of?
1. Exploring the Arduino Boards and taking a look at the IDE
1. What are digital and analog signals?
1. how to control a simple digital signals
1. Creating a blinking LED wave using Arduino
1. what are variables and how to use them on Arduino
1. The principle of good programming called DRY(meaning do not repeat yourself) and how to apply it in your program by using:
  - for loops
  - functions 
    - void functions(returns no value)
    - functions that returns a value
    - functions with no attributes/parameters
    - functions with attributes/parameters
  - while loops
  - do while loops, etc

#### Arduino Projects
1. PIR sensor based intruder alarm with arduino(motion sensor).
1. 4 way traffic light with smart street light(darkness sensitive using LDR).
1. 4 function calculator using keypad adn 16 x 2 lcd.
2. Remote controlled home automation(wireless control) using bluetooth module HC-05.
1. Remote controlled car.
1. Simple obstacle avoiding car controlled car.
1. Adding SMS capability to the PIR sensor based intruder alarm built earlier.
1. Distance digital measuring Machine.
1. Smart Intruder Alarm with ESP32 Camera(takes pics and send to owner via telegram/whatsapp/email)
1. 


### Git Version Control and GitHub
1. what is git version control, github, CLI.
1. How to navigate using the CMDER CLI(command line interface).
1. how to make a directory(AKA folder), files(eg: text files, arduino files, etc)


remember: do project count for non programing and programming
