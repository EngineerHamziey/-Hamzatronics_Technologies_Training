### Pure Electronics without programming

1. Identification of Electronics components.
1. Resistor Color Codes and number codes.
1. Capacitor Color codes and number codes.
1. How to use the BreadBoard and jumper wires
1. Multivibrators: Monostable, Astable and Bistable
1. Application of Monostable, intruder Alarm(project: 1)
1. Application of Monostable, Power restore alarm (project: 2)
1. How To Combine Monostable, Astable and Bistable.
1. Intruder / thief Alarm using Combined Monostable and Astable(project: 3)
1. Power restore Alarm using Combined Monostable and Astable(project: 4)
1. How to make a Touch Switch(project: 5)
1. Resistors: series, parallel, voltage dividers, potentiometer, thermostat, LDR, and other variable resistors
1. Fuse blown Alarm
1. LDR based lamp (night detection)(project: 6)
1. Comparator and how to use them(eg: LM393).
1. How to make a Switching delay circuit using Monostable.(project: 7)
1. How to make a Surge Protector Using LM393 bistable Multivibrator(project: 7)
1. What is a Power supply? why we need it and types of
1. Transformer Power supply and how to make one(rectification, voltage regulation, etc )
1. Building a 12v power supply(project: 8)
1. Fixed Voltage regulators(the LM78XX family) and variable voltage regulators(eg: LM373)
1. Capacitive Power supply and how to make one.
1. Power Supply related modules and how they work: TP4056 li ion charging module, Boost converter, Bulk converter, AC - DC converters.
1. Voltage, Power and Current Calculation (P = IV)
1. Application of the above learnt calculation in calculating the time of charge and the backup time of an Energy system(eg: a solar system)

### Arduino Basics

1. What are Programmable ICs (and Arduino to be precise) and what are they capable of?
1. Exploring the Arduino Boards and taking a look at the IDE
1. What are digital and analog signals?
1. how to control a simple digital signals
1. Creating a blinking LED wave using Arduino
1. what are variables and how to use them on Arduino
1. The principle of good programming called DRY(meaning do not repeat yourself) and how to apply it in your program by using:

- for loops
- while loops
- do while loops, etc
- functions
  - void functions(returns no value)
  - functions that returns a value
  - functions with no attributes/parameters
  - functions with attributes/parameters

#### Arduino Projects

1. PIR sensor based intruder alarm with arduino(motion sensor).
1. 4 way traffic light with smart street light(darkness sensitive using LDR).
1. 4 function calculator using keypad adn 16 x 2 lcd.
1. Remote controlled home automation(wireless control) using bluetooth module HC-05.
1. Remote controlled car.
1. Simple obstacle avoiding car controlled car.
1. Adding SMS capability to the PIR sensor based intruder alarm built earlier.
1. Distance digital measuring Machine.
1. Smart Intruder Alarm with ESP32 Camera(takes pics and send to owner via telegram/whatsapp/email).
1. Smart water level monitoring  and control system using Ultrasonic sensor.
1. Password based doorlock.
1. Automatic door(using motion sensor).
1. Self Balancing Robot Car.
1. And some Impromptu customer projects.

### Git Version Control and GitHub

1. what is git version control, github, CLI.
1. How to navigate through files and directories using the CMDER CLI(command line interface).
1. How to make a directory(AKA folder), files(eg: text files, arduino files, etc).
1. How to write GitHub markdown(like this one I wrote [click here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EngineerHamziey/-Hamzatronics_Technologies_Training/master/README.md) to view the raw Markdown code for this)

Version control commands, how they work, and how to use them efficiently. ***Commands like:***

1. git config
1. git init
1. git clone
1. git add
1. git commit
1. git diff
1. git status
1. git reset
1. git rm
1. git log
1. git show
1. git tag
1. git branch
1. git checkout
1. git merge
1. git remote
1. git push
1. etc.
